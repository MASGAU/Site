$content = 'Dropbox is a wonderful program that creates a special folder on your computer. Anything you put in that folder gets magically transferred onto the Internet. If you set MASGAU to put its backups in the Dropbox folder, then all your save archives will be immediately uploaded for safe storage. If you install Dropbox with the same account on a different computer, it will download everything that has been uploaded, effectively creating the exact same folder on the second computer. If you use Dropbox with MASGAU, this means that you can have all your saves automatically appear on all your computers!
