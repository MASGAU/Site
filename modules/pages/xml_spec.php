That link should provide all the info you need to add your own games. 
Unfortunately, it\'s a little complicated! 
To counter this, MASGAU includes an analyzer component, 
which (with your help) automatically scans your computer for all the info needed to add a game to the GameSave.Info database (which also means adding it to MASGAU)! 
It\'ll even e-mail it to me with the click of a button!';
